# Machine Learning Works on Titanic Data Set

The Titanic dataset is popular for data analysis and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers onboard the Titanic, including features like age, gender, fare, cabin, and survival status. In this project, you will see usage of some dimension reduction algorithms and machine learning works.

There are 2 notebooks in this file. One of them carries machine learning applications, other one has dimension reduction algorithm usages.
